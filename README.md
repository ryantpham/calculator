# JavaScript Calculator Project
https://ryantpham.github.io/calculator/ 
## Introduction
This JavaScript Calculator Project marks a significant milestone in my programming journey, showcasing the application of fundamental JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills. The project's goal was to create an interactive on-screen calculator, combining the core concepts learned in my recent studies.

## Project Overview
The calculator features basic math operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interface includes buttons for each digit, operations, a clear button, and an "Equals" key, along with a display area for showing calculations and results.

### Key Features:
- Basic math functions: `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()`.
- A central `operate()` function that executes the chosen mathematical operation.
- Interactive buttons to input numbers and operations.
- A clear button to reset calculations.
- An updating display that shows the current operation and the result.
- Additional features like handling decimals and backspace for error correction.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Learning Outcomes
Throughout this project, I learned and applied several key concepts:

1. **JavaScript Functions and Logic:** Writing functions for various mathematical operations and implementing the logic for calculations.

2. **DOM Manipulation:** Interactively updating the display and responding to user inputs by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM).

3. **CSS Styling:** Designing a user-friendly interface and ensuring the calculator is aesthetically pleasing and functional.

4. **Debugging and Problem-Solving:** Overcoming challenges such as handling chained operations, dealing with floating-point numbers, and ensuring a bug-free user experience.

5. **Version Control:** Using Git for version control, committing changes regularly and understanding the importance of maintaining a clean and organized codebase.

## Challenges and Solutions
- Implementing chained calculations was a complex task. I approached this by breaking down the problem into smaller parts and handling each operation sequentially.
- Rounding long decimals was important to maintain display clarity, which I addressed using JavaScript's `toFixed()` method.
- Preventing errors in case of incomplete inputs or division by zero, I added checks and displayed appropriate error messages.

## Conclusion
This project was a comprehensive exercise in applying foundational web development skills. It challenged me to think critically and creatively, honing my problem-solving abilities. It's a testament to my growth as a developer and serves as a solid foundation for future learning and projects.
